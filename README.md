# üöó RideRecords: Decentralized Vehicle History

## üöÄ Overview
**RideRecords** is an innovative decentralized application (dApp) built on the **Scaffold-Lisk** framework, designed to bring transparency and immutability to vehicle history records. Tired of odometer fraud, hidden accident histories, and untraceable ownership transfers? RideRecords leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, verifiable, and permanent ledger for every vehicle.

Powered by **Next.js**, **Hardhat**, **Wagmi**, **Viem**, and **RainbowKit**, this application demonstrates how a modern web interface can seamlessly interact with smart contracts to manage crucial vehicle data. From registration to ownership transfers and maintenance records, every significant event in a vehicle's life is recorded on-chain, creating a single source of truth accessible to everyone.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Decentralized Vehicle Registration**: Register new vehicles on the blockchain with essential details, creating an immutable genesis record.
-   **Secure Ownership Transfer**: Facilitate transparent and verifiable vehicle ownership changes, securely recorded on-chain.
-   **Verified Maintenance History**: Owners can add maintenance logs, mileage updates, and other critical events, building a comprehensive service history.
-   **Personalized Vehicle Management**: A "My Vehicles" page allows connected users to view all vehicles they currently own, with quick access to detailed records via an interactive modal.
-   **Intuitive & Responsive UI**: A beautifully crafted user interface, inspired by modern design principles, ensures a smooth and engaging experience across all devices.
-   **Multi-language Support**: Seamlessly switch between English and Spanish for a broader user base.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

**Smart Contracts & Blockchain Interaction:**
-   **Solidity**: For writing the `RideRecords.sol` smart contract.
-   **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
-   **Wagmi & Viem**: React hooks and low-level interfaces for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts and the blockchain.
-   **RainbowKit**: A comprehensive wallet connection library for a seamless user authentication experience.
-   **Base Sepolia**: The target Superchain testnet for contract deployment and interaction.

**Frontend & Backend (Next.js SSR for MVP):**
-   **Next.js (React)**: A powerful React framework for building fast and scalable web applications, handling both client-side rendering and server-side rendering (SSR) for API routes.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.
-   **`db.json` (Local Storage)**: For hackathon MVP purposes, a simple JSON file acts as a local "database" managed via Next.js API routes to store off-chain vehicle details and historical events that complement on-chain data.
-   **`nanoid`**: Used for generating unique IDs for off-chain records.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The RideRecords application follows a hybrid architecture, combining the benefits of decentralized blockchain storage with a performant Next.js frontend.

-   **Frontend**: Built with Next.js, it provides the user interface for interacting with the dApp. It leverages `wagmi` and `scaffold-lisk`'s custom hooks to send transactions and read data from the `RideRecords` smart contract.
-   **Smart Contract (`RideRecords.sol`)**: Deployed on the Base Sepolia testnet, this Solidity contract manages core vehicle ownership and event immutability.
-   **Next.js API Routes (Backend)**: For the hackathon MVP, server-side API routes are implemented in Next.js to handle persistent storage of richer vehicle metadata and detailed event histories in a local `db.json` file. These routes are called after successful on-chain transactions to synchronize off-chain data.

## üìÇ Project Structure

-   `packages/hardhat`: Contains the `RideRecords.sol` smart contract, deployment scripts, and Hardhat configuration.
-   `packages/nextjs`: Houses the Next.js frontend application, including pages, components, hooks, styles, and API routes.
    -   `app/`: Next.js App Router pages (e.g., `/`, `/register`, `/my-vehicles`, `/vehicle/[serialHash]`).
    -   `components/`: Reusable React components, including `TopLeftLogo` and `TopRightNavigation`.
    -   `app/api/`: Next.js API routes for interacting with `db.json`.
    -   `db.json`: The local JSON file acting as a mock database.
-   `README.md`: This document.
-   `PRD.md`: The Product Requirements Document outlining the project goals.

## ‚ö° Quickstart

Follow these steps to get your RideRecords dApp up and running:

1.  **Clone the repository & install dependencies**:

    ```bash
git clone https://github.com/pauliro/ride-record-lisk.git
cd scaffold-lisk
yarn install
```

2.  **Run a local blockchain network**:
    Open a new terminal and run:

    ```bash
yarn chain
```
    This command starts a local Hardhat development network, essential for deploying and testing your smart contracts.

3.  **Deploy the `RideRecords` smart contract**:
    Open another terminal (while `yarn chain` is still running) and deploy the contract:

    ```bash
yarn deploy
```
    This deploys the `RideRecords.sol` contract to your local network.

4.  **Start the Next.js frontend application**:
    In a third terminal, start the Next.js development server:

    ```bash
yarn start
```
    Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìñ Usage Instructions

1.  **Connect Your Wallet**: On any page, use the wallet connector in the top-right corner to connect your Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect). Ensure you're connected to the **Base Sepolia** network (or your local Hardhat network for development).
2.  **Register a New Vehicle**:
    -   Navigate to the "Register Vehicle" page (accessible via the top-right navigation or the landing page CTA).
    -   Fill in the vehicle details.
    -   Click "Register Vehicle" and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
    -   Upon successful transaction, the vehicle will be registered on-chain, and its initial details will be stored off-chain.
3.  **View Your Vehicles**:
    -   Click "My Vehicles" in the top-right navigation.
    -   You'll see a list of all vehicles currently registered to your connected wallet address.
    -   Click on any vehicle card to open a modal displaying its comprehensive details and history.
4.  **Add Maintenance Records**:
    -   From a vehicle's detail page (accessed via "My Vehicles"), if you are the current owner, you can add maintenance records.
    -   Enter a description and submit.
5.  **Transfer Ownership**:
    -   From a vehicle's detail page, if you are the current owner, you can initiate an ownership transfer.
    -   Enter the recipient's Ethereum address and the current odometer reading.
    -   Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development & Customization

-   **Smart Contract Logic**: Modify `packages/hardhat/contracts/RideRecords.sol` to update contract functionalities.
-   **Frontend UI**: Develop and enhance the user interface in `packages/nextjs/app`, `components`, and `styles`.
-   **Deployment**: Adjust deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy` for different network configurations.
-   **Local Backend**: Modify Next.js API routes in `packages/nextjs/app/api` to change how off-chain data is handled.

## üåü Future Enhancements

-   **IPFS Integration**: Store maintenance evidence and other documents directly on IPFS for true decentralization of all assets.
-   **Advanced Backend**: Migrate `db.json` to a more robust database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for production-grade persistent storage and scalability.
-   **Rich Event Types**: Introduce more granular event types (e.g., accident reports, inspection records) with richer metadata.
-   **Notification System**: Implement real-time notifications for vehicle events (e.g., ownership transfer complete, new maintenance added).
-   **Search Functionality**: Implement a global search by VIN, license plate, or serial hash.

## üôè Credits
